# Handwritten Character Recognition Project

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
We used two datasets for this project:
- **EMNIST (Extended MNIST):** [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist/code)
- **Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset (AHCD):** [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mloey1/ahcd1)

## ðŸ§  Models Used
We implemented and experimented with three different models:

1. **ResNet:** Built from scratch to learn and classify characters effectively.
2. **Pretrained Xception:** Leveraged transfer learning to adapt the powerful Xception architecture to our dataset.
3. **DenseNet:** Employed DenseNet for its efficient feature propagation and compact model size.
